POX Cluster Utility

Scince POX doesn't support sending master selection messages, this is a JGroups-based utility to support cluster model with POX. It uses no OpenFlow protocol or paradigm, only synchronization between controllers nodes.

In time from all the nodes one master-node selected, which performs all actions on POX Controller, while others just wait and monitor it's state. In case of poor perfomance or loss of connection, or suspection for crash - slave nodes invoke atomic change-master method and the whole process repeats.

Requires: Java 1.7+, JGroups, log4j, apache-common-utils
