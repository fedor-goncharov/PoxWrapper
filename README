POX Cluster Utility

Scince POX doesn't support sending master selection messages, this is a JGroups-based utility to support cluster model with POX. 
It uses no OpenFlow protocol or paradigm, but only synchronization between controllers nodes.

In time from all the nodes one master-node selected, which performs all actions on POX Controller, while others 
just wait and monitor it's state. In case of poor perfomance or loss of connection, or suspection for crash - slave 
nodes invoke atomic change-master method and the whole process repeats.

Requires: Java 1.7+, JGroups, log4j, apache-common-utils

Installation:

   1) Copy project to your hard drive and open it in Eclipse
   2) Export project as executable JAR file
   3) Set properties file for log4j, if you don't do that an exception will be thrown and the programm will run without logging

P.S. This was a diploma project; the project still contains sever bug related to JGroups (switching to master controller), 
maybe one day I will work on it again.
